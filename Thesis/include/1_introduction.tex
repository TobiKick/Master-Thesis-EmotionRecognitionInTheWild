% VISUAL Emotion Recognition. Connecting Human Intention to Emotion Recognition. Research is sparse on this.

Main goal: Implement a prototype that is able to visually recognize human emotions in the wild, more specifically, during real-time video calls.

Hypothesis:
- Emotion recognition in real-time video calls is a viable option that can be performed with state-of-the-art techniques.
- Based upon the AFEW-VA dataset, the proposed approach can recognize emotions as well as the current literature.
- Achieved results can be implemented in a prototype that recognizes emotions during real-time video calls.

Contribution: First of its kind, in a way. While existing studies have touched on emotion classification and measurement, as well as fusing audio, or brain activity-related cues to visual cues in order to determine emotion, there are no existing studies regarding real-time emotion recognition and intention determination. A lot of studies have either tried to classify and measure emotions. There's been a study that's successfully determined intention, but through EEG.
