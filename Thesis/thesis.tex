\chapter{Abstract}
\hl{Why this Master thesis?}\newline
It explores the possibilities of Emotion Recognition In-The-Wild with a specific application focus on video call consultations. (together with PPI AG)
\newline\newline
\hl{Research questions/hypothesis}\newline
The following three research hypothesis are tackled through the thesis:\newline
\begin{itemize}
    \item When using In-The-Wild data for training and testing, emotions can still be recognized reliably and possibly beat the state-of-the-art results in current literature.
    \item When examining the implemented modules separately, each module contributes positively towards the performance of the overall architecture.
    \item When implementing Emotion Recognition in a prototype application, it performs well with real-time video input from a webcam and can map recognized emotions to human intentions.
\end{itemize}

% This Master's thesis started off with setting out three hypotheses which are now being scrutinized whether the researcher could confirm or disprove those hypotheses.\newline\newline
% \textbf{Hypothese \#1: Emotions can be recognized reliably from In-The-Wild data used for training and testing. Furthermore, the results can beat the state-of-the-art outcomes demonstrated in current literature.}\newline
% Under the assumption, that the AFEW-VA dataset, consiting of talk-show and movie clips, represents authentic In-The-Wild data, the researcher could prove that emotions could be recognized reliably as the reported results confirm. The researcher could indeed beat the results of one out of two state-of-the-art scientific papers.
% \newline\newline
% \textbf{Hypothese \#2: When examining the implemented modules separately, each module contributes positively towards the performance of the overall architecture.}\newline
% Through the rigorous ablation study of separate modules, the researcher underlined the importance of individual modules and could show that all major components contribute positively towards the architecture's performance.
% \newline\newline
% \textbf{Hypothese \#3: In a prototype application, Emotion Recognition will perform well with real-time video input from a webcam. It will be able to map recognized emotions to human intentions effectively.}\newline
% In order to prove this hypothese, the researcher created a small prototype application that could recognize emotions in real-time from the person's face in front of the web camera. Furthermore, the researcher devised a mapping mechanism from emotional valence to interest and he tried to further validate the viability of this approach through a user experiment. The experiment, however, disproved that one can map recognized emotions to human intentions effectively.

\hl{What was achieved?}\newline

- prototype application
